INSTRUCTIONS
This lab takes as input a CSV (comma separated values) file (.csv extension) that is used for generating tabular data in spreadsheets. Specifically, for this assignment, you will NEED to assume this CSV file was generated in Windows (the reason will be explained shortly). 

Create a program that does the following:
1. Find the total file size in bytes (excluding any metadata generated by your OS)
2. Calculate the total income generated from all stocks
3. Find the stock that gave maximum returns.
