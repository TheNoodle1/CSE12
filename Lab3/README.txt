Lab 3: Looping in RISC-V Assembly

DESCRIPTION
To prompt the user for the height of the pattern and verify whether the input is valid or not. If not, an error message is to be printed and the user will be prompted again. If a valid entry is input, create a hollow right-angled triangle use stars, blank spaces, and newline characters.

INSTRUCTIONS
This lab will introduce you to the RISC-V assembly language programming using RARS. You will write a
program with nested loops in the file Lab3.asm to write a specific pattern to a file by the name of
